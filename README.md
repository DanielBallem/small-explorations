# Small Explorations

This section is dedicated to tiny projects that don't really amount to a proper project in a portfolio, but I think still deserve a place to be showcased.

The topics and technology I use will differ depending on what I'm interested in at the time. If I feel like sharing something I'll dump it in here. It will be organized by project name, or by categories if I find that some of them can fit into a common superfolder. As well, each project will include a README explaining things in further detail.

You can think of this as some kind of dev journal.
