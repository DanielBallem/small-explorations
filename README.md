# Small Explorations

This section is dedicated to tiny projects that don't really amount to a proper project in a portfolio, but I think still deserve a place to be showcased.

The topics and technology used vary wildly dependant on what I'm interested at the time, and so whenever I feel like sharing something I'll dump it in here. It will be organized by category, and each category will have a readme explaining things in further detail.
