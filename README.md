# Small Explorations

This section is dedicated to tiny projects that don't really amount to a proper project in a portfolio, but I think still deserve a place to be showcased.

The topics and technology used vary wildly dependant on what I'm interested at the time, and so whenever I feel like sharing something I'll dump it in here. It will be organized by category, and each category will have a readme explaining things in further detail.

You can think of this as some kind of dev journal. Since the technology used may not be the same, the code here won't have any git ignores, or perhaps all the files needed to create the output. It's highly recommended that you don't pull it all down for your own use. It's simply to show what I like to do in my spare time.
