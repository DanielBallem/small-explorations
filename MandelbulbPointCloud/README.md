## Mandelbulb calculation

### Created March 13th (uploaded much later)

Inspired by the coding train video on the same topic, I felt motivated to implement my version of the Mandelbulb in processing using a point cloud. 

Referring to a resource detailing the equations necessary to implement such a bulb, I managed to slowly understand exactly what was being done. It took a while, but I was quite satisfied with the result.

At the time I made this, I had just begun my journey through reading Robert Martin's book on clean code. I was deadset on practicing it and took this little project as an opportunity to try it out. 

You'll find throughout the source files that each method is incredibly small, having been extracted with descriptive function names and variables. Each function tries to clearly explain what it does on a need-to-know basis. 

I am quite pleased that after months of having this buried in my documents folder, I can jump to any function in the code and understand what it's doing.
