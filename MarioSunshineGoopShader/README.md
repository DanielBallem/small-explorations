## Mario Sunshine Goop in Unity using URP Shader Graph

One of my favourite games growing up was Super Mario Sunshine on the Game Cube. For years it continued to be my "comfort game", running around and admiring the unique and tropical atmosphere, it really did capture my imagination as a kid. 

One of the most notable aspects of the game is mario sunshine's goop. A thick and harmful substance that would cling onto surroundings and spawn enemies.

As a kid, I was incredibly bewildered as to how they could have done something like that. to be able to paint any surface and spawn creatures from it. However, now that I'm much older and can do some basic research, I realized how limiting and simple it actually is.

I used to think it was all dynamic, until I discovered through a file dump that every single goop or "pollution" spread is dictated by a flat texture that spans across a section of a map. This would be applied on top of a floor or wall in order to control what could be polluted and what the shape of it would be.

As soon as I realized how easy it would be, I immediately booted up unity and hopped into shader graph.
